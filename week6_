##Farthest First Traversal heuristic, whose pseudocode is shown below
#FarthestFirstTraversal(Data, k) 
# Centers ← the set consisting of a single randomly chosen point from Data
# while |Centers| < k 
#   DataPoint ← the point in Data maximizing d(DataPoint, Centers) 
#   add DataPoint to Centers 
# return Centers 
#Input: Integers k and m followed by a set of points Data in m-dimensional space.
#Output: A set Centers consisting of k points (centers) resulting from applying
#FarthestFirstTraversal(Data, k), where the first point from Data is chosen as the first center to initialize the algorithm.
